## 1. Project Overview

The goal of this project was to practice all learned in EDA and Statistical Analysis lessons.

I've chosen a raw dataset from Kaggle. I saw it could be very interesting to study. First of all I had to analyze and process the messy data.

Then I did statistical analysis using the iterative data analysis process to the data set.

Data source: http://wwww.kaggle.com/datasets/anandaramg/taxi-trip-data-nyc

## 2. Project Steps

Understand the data -> Manipulate the data (process and clean) -> Analyse the data -> Analysis of relationship between variables

Import data.
Data wrangling: formatting, cleaning and filtering the valuable data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Data explotarion techniques to understand the various aspects of the data.
Examine the relationships between the features in the dataset. Data visualization and statistical analysis.
Present the findings in statistical summary and data visualization.
